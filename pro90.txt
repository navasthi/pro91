Riya is a social worker, she prepares meals for the covid-infected people. An app which notifies her when and where a person needs a meal would be
really helpful. The first screen would be a login or register page, when you are registered the screen will request you to enable your location so 
that Riya knows the location of where the food needs to be delivered. After that, the third screen, will have a menu with checkboxes on the side of the food
item so you can select what you want to eat and then press on a button on the bottom of the screen that says 'place order'. After that the person gets the
notification 'Your order has been placed, Get well soon :)' and then they have 3 icons on the bottom of each screen, one for the home page, one for the
location page and one for the orders placed page. Once the person places the order, Riya will get a notification to what the person has ordered and where
the food is to be delivered. Riya can also have a 'TO DO' page where all the pending orders get automatically listed and she can check them off once they
are delivered.When the order has reached the destination, Riya will get a notification saying 'Order delivered'.
